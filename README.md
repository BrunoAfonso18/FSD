# FSD - Distributed Systems

This project consists in the client/server comunication using java sockets and rmi methods.

## Instalation 

Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/FSD.git 
```

## Run

Get 2 to 3 terminals (in vscode split the terminal). You will need 1 for the server end and another for 1 of the client types (Socket or RMI).
Make sure you start the server before you start any of the clients.

Terminal 1:
```bash
javac Server/Server.java
java Server/Server
```

Terminal 2 (for Socket Client):
```bash
javac Client/CLient.java
java Client/Client
```

Terminal 2 (for RMI Client):
```bash
javac Client/RMICLient.java
java Client/RMIClient
```

This displays both comunication ends in a stock of 4 products and contains unfinished security measures in the requests and responses.
